## 🚀 How to Run (No Installation Required)

**You do NOT need to install OpenGL, MinGW, or any developer tools.**  
Just follow these steps:

### ✔ 1. Download the `bin/` folder from this repository  
Inside this folder you will find:
- `opengl_app.exe`
- `glfw3.dll`
- `libgcc_s_seh-1.dll`
- `libstdc++-6.dll`
- `libwinpthread-1.dll`


### ✔ 2. Make sure all these files stay in the same folder

Example:

bin/
opengl_app.exe
glfw3.dll
libgcc_s_seh-1.dll
libstdc++-6.dll
libwinpthread-1.dll

### ✔ 3. Double-click `opengl_app.exe` — It will run immediately 🎉  
No setup required!

Windows already includes OpenGL through GPU drivers  
(NVIDIA / AMD / Intel), so no extra installation needed.
